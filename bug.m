In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management and object lifecycles, specifically with regards to retaining objects within blocks.  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSMutableArray *myArray;

- (void)someMethod {
    [self.myArray enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
        // Incorrect: Directly using 'obj' without retaining it.
        // The object might be deallocated before the block completes.
        [self doSomethingWithObject:obj];
    }];
}
```

The problem is that `obj` inside the block is a local variable with a strong reference only within the block's scope. If `self.myArray` is modified or deallocated during the block's execution, `obj` may become invalid, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
